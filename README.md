# TensorTwitterModel
Trained Twitter Sentiment TensortFlow model trained from [https://vgpena.github.io/classifying-tweets-with-keras-and-tensorflow/](https://vgpena.github.io/classifying-tweets-with-keras-and-tensorflow/)

## Source and Credit
As mentioned (vgpena)[https://vgpena.github.io/] deserves all the credit. She built the model I just ran the training for a few hours and thought I would bang this up to save someone the time incase they just wanted to play around

## Purpose

If anyone wanted to get started on sentiment with a pre-built model I found Violet's blog post to be the best place to start.
